# TrackMyHabits by CosmicWhiskers, 2024
 The Habit Tracker offers a straightforward, user-friendly tool compatible with any platform that supports Python 3. To keep the application lightweight and widely accessible, itâ€™s designed to run within a command-line interface, making it usable even on systems without a graphical user interface.

Users can track their habits effortlessly by creating, managing and viewing habits in an organized layout. Doing so, helps them monitor their progress. Analytics features provide insights, such as number of habits, habit streaks, top-performing and more.

This habit-tracker is being created in the context of a continuing education course (Data Analyst - Python) for the module "Object-Oriented and Functional Programming with Python (DLBDSOOFPP01)".
